Six years ago i was working on a project with my friends we were creating a web application, back then only i had a Github Account so i was the one who's pushing all the work while working at that app i was taking care of the design of the app , for months has passed and we got a buyer for the product anyways the guy who was taking care of the servers got a bug wich we coulden't understand anyways we decided to delete the work and to clone the last update on github since at that time it was the easiest thing we could do since we were running out of time then it happends we diden't find anything on the repository yes sadly i tought i was pushing but i diden't push anything i legit never read the messages i got after pushing and none of us ever checked the repository the only thing that was on Github was an empty README file everyone hated me i felt so bad the project got cancled we never spoke again.
